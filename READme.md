# MERN Stack Database

A Comic Book Library using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). Here are some of the topics this project helped me with:

- Backend CRUD
- Backend Router
- CORS Policy
- MongoDB operations
- Frontend CRUD
- Frontend Router

This is a fully functional MERN Stack App as of 12 Feb 24

### Known Bugs 12.2.24

On the info card the date stamp is showing as Invalid.

## Stretch Goals

- Add a background image to the site of comic book art.
- On the modal be able to enter review of each comic.
- On the modal have a thumbs up or thumbs down to show if I like it
- Change the font to match the style of a comic library.

I'm really happy with how the basic structure of this database has worked and I will be using this code as the basis of every MERN project I put together in the future.
